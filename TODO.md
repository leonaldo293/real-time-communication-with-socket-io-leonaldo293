# TODO: Implement Complete React Chat Application

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Refactor App.jsx to manage global state (socket, users, rooms, messages, unread counts), connection logic, and render sub-components
- [x] Create ChatRoom.jsx component for room selection, joining/leaving rooms, and integrating chat interface
- [x] Create UserList.jsx component (based on Sidebar.jsx) to show online/offline users and handle private message initiation

- [x] Update App.css for responsive design (mobile/desktop)
- [x] Rename/edit Sidebar.css to UserList.css
- [x] Update ChatWindow.css to ChatRoom.css
- [x] Add logic for private messages via unique room names (e.g., 'private-user1-user2')
- [x] Implement unread message counts per room
- [x] Add read receipts by emitting 'message_read' events
- [x] Ensure typing indicators, notification sound, and browser notifications work
